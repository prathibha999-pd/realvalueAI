Machine Learning Assignment — Guidelines  
Objective  
The objective of this assignment is to enable students to collect a local dataset, apply a 
new machine learning algorithm, evaluate and explain the model, and optionally integrate 
it into a front -end system.  
 
Task Description  
Students must identify a real -world problem, collect or compile a dataset, apply a 
machine learning algorithm not taught in lectures, train and evaluate it, and explain the 
results using XAI techniques.  Avoid developi ng an image processing application .    
Guidelines  
1. Problem Definition & Dataset Collection (15 marks)  
• Clearly describe the problem and its relevance.  
• Explain:  
o Data source (how and from where it was collected),  
o Features and target variable,  
o Size of the dataset,  
• Any preprocessing done (cleaning, encoding, normalization).  
o Ensure  ethical data use (no personal or sensitive data without consent).  
 
2. Selection of a New Machine Learning Algorithm (15 marks)   
• Choose an algorithm  not covered during lectures  and avoid using deep learning 
models . 
• Justify:  
o Why was this algorithm  selected,  
o How it differs from standard models (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression, 
k-NN, etc.).  
3. Model Training and Evaluation (20 marks)  
• Explain:  
o Train/validation/test split,  
o Hyperparameter choices,  
o Performance metrics used (accuracy, F1, RMSE, AUC, etc. depending on 
task),  
o Results obtained and what they indicate.  
• Include tables, graphs, or plots where appropriate.  
 
4. Explainability & Interpretation (20 marks)  
• Apply at least one explainability method , such as:  
o SHAP  
o LIME  
o Feature importance analysis  
o Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)  
• Explain:  
o What the model has learned,  
o Which features are most influential,  
o Whether the model’s behavior aligns with domain knowledge.  
 
5. Critical Discussion (10 marks)  
• Limitations of the model,  
• Data quality issues,  
• Risks of bias or unfairness,  
• Potential real -world impact and ethical considerations.  
 
6. Report Quality & Technical Clarity (10 marks)  
7. Bonus: Front -End Integration (10 marks)  
Bonus marks will be awarded for:  
• Integrating the trained model into a front -end system (web app, dashboard, mobile 
app, etc.).  
• Allowing users to input data and view predictions/explanations.  
• Examples: Streamlit app, Flask + HTML, React frontend, etc.  
 
Submission Requirements  
•  Written Report (PDF ) 
Including problem description, methodology , results, interpretation, and discussion.  
•  Source Code (ZIP  / GitHub link )  
Including data preprocessing, traini ng, evaluation, and explainability scripts.   
•  Dataset (if publicly shareable)  or a description of how it was obtained.  
•  Demo video (3 –5 minutes)  showing the front -end system.  
Upload your submission t o the Moodle course page.
